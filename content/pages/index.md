Intro: I am a Javascript developer who loves working on challenging projects and open source. I started out as a ceramic artist, but as is common these days, picked up programming in my spare time.  Since then I have been working almost completely in javascript, with a few stints into PHP and Go, but Javascript, with all its warts, keeps me coming back.
