A configurable and extensible content management system for node applications.  Rufio can be used to mix in basic content managemnt into existing node applications, or build complicated content applications from scratch.  The goal is to provide the basic tools for creating websites or applications off common components.  Rufio supports local content on the filesystem, or remote content over http.  It has both a static site generator and an Express server that you can use depending on your use case.
