YeoPress is a <a href="http://yeoman.io" title="Modern Workflows For Modern Webapps">Yeoman</a> generator for <a href="http://wordpres.org" title="WordPress">WordPress</a>.  It is optimized for a workflow using Git, Sass and Require.js, but can be integrated into the simplest of workflows.  Adopting the ideals and tools of Yeoman, YeoPress integrates Yo to scaffold out your WP site, then provides a Grunt.js configuration and a base theme with Bower for asset management.

YeoPress is under active development, and will have things like WP upgrades, a plugin for running tasks from in the admin, database migrations, and other useful WordPress workflow helpers.  My personal goal for the project is to help developers integrate modern workflow practices into their process with as little work as possiable. To see how it works, watch this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSG0P5VpSUk">intro video</a>.
