		<h1>Who is this guy?</h1>
	</header>
	<div class="content">
		<p>This guy is a web developer.  This guy is a Javascripter.  He is obsessed with CSS.  Has three first names.  Takes pictures sometimes.  Spends too much time working on the next new project.  This guy likes to read, drink local beer and geek out on technology. Passionate, driven, articulate, positive, creative.  This guy dreams about HTML and works on side projects at lunch.  This guy is a husband, loves art, ceramics and life.</p>
		<p>In all of the things I do, I try to bring passion and skill.  While working on over a hundred different websites, ranging from eCommerce to non-profits, I have continually improved my skills and knowledge.  Today I live and work in Austin, Texas where I have found a great community of developers through work and meet-ups who all share my passion and expertise.</p>

			<h3><a href="https://github.com/wesleytodd/YeoPress">YeoPress</a></h3>
			<p>YeoPress is a <a href="http://yeoman.io" title="Modern Workflows For Modern Webapps">Yeoman</a> generator for <a href="http://wordpres.org" title="WordPress">WordPress</a>.  It is optimized for a workflow using Git, Sass and Require.js, but can be integrated into the simplest of workflows.  Adopting the ideals and tools of Yeoman, YeoPress integrates Yo to scaffold out your WP site, then provides a Grunt.js configuration and a base theme with Bower for asset management.</p>
			<p>YeoPress is under active development, and will have things like WP upgrades, a plugin for running tasks from in the admin, database migrations, and other useful WordPress workflow helpers.  My personal goal for the project is to help developers integrate modern workflow practices into their process with as little work as possiable. To see how it works, watch this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSG0P5VpSUk">intro video</a>.</p>

			<h3><a href="https://github.com/wesleytodd/Universal-Forms">Universal Forms</a></h3>
			<p>Universal Forms is more of a standard than a project.  The problem is that web forms are hard.  And then you have to implement both inline validation, and server-side validation.  So you have to implement your validation logic on both sides, and when changes come up, you have to do them in two places.  And then throw on top of that that it is almost always in two different languages (Javascript and &lt;INSERT YOUR BACKEND HERE>).  Universal Forms is an attempt to create an interchange format for both sides to understand.  You can have your form defined in a single JSON file, and just write a driver to support your specific needs.</p>
			<p>The project part of this comes because I am writing implementations.  I currently have an integration for <a href="http://laravel.com/">Laravel</a> and <a href="http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/">jQuery Validation</a>.  The core libraries are available in PHP and Javascript, and am intending to write the next implementation in <a href="http://golang.org">Go</a>.</p>

			</div>
			<h3><a href="https://github.com/wesleytodd/Carder">Carder</a></h3>
			<p>This plugin adds credit card logos and ccid/ccv images which dynamically update based on the input in the credit card field. The plugin will try and match the shortest possible number for each type by default. When the field loses focus the field is validated and if is not valid an error will be added and the field will only validate a full card number.</p>

			</div>
			<h3><a href="https://github.com/wesleytodd/Match-Media-Manager">Match Media Manager</a></h3>
			<p>MatchMediaManager is a library to assist with JavaScript callbacks based on Media Queries. For example, if a link opens a light-box when on a large screen, but you need to re-direct that to a single page version of the content for small screens.</p>

			<h3><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-custom-admin-bar/">WP Custom Admin Bar</a></h3>
			<p>A WordPress Plugin that helps gain control of the Admin Bar. This gives you options to change who sees the Admin Bar based on their user role, change or override the default styling and remove the Admin Bar altogether.</p>
			<p>With over 30,000 downloads and a 4.5 star rating, this plugin is a sure bet when you need to wrangle that Admin Bar for your users.</p>

			</div>
			<h3><a href="https://github.com/wesleytodd/LeSlide">LeSlide</a></h3>
			<p>A new take on label placement for form elements.  This jQuery plugin places the label inside the input, and when the input receives focus, the label slides to the right.  Based on usability studies, the less you make user's eyes travel the better.  So if labels to the left of their fields is better than above, it makes sense that labels inside the field would be even better.</p>
