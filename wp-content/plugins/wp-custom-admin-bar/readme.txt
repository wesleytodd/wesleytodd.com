== Description ==

A really simple and easy to use plugin to help gain control of the new Admin Bar.
This gives you options to change who sees the Admin Bar based on their user role, 
change or override the default styling or remove the Admin Bar altogether.
It adds a menu to the Admin Bar which gives you the ability to disable it on a 
single page or sitewide for a single browser session.

WP Custom Admin Bar supports Custom Roles.

== Installation ==

1. Extract 'wp-custom-admin-bar' and transfer it to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Visit the setting page to customize your admin bar (be sure to save your settings!)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I disable the Admin Bar for just one browsing session or on just one specific page? =

Yes you can! As of version 1.0 there is a menu item in the admin bar to disable the 
bar on a page by page basis or for the entire site.  This setting is for a single browser 
session, so if you close your browser the settings reset.

= When I disable the Admin Bar for a given User Role, does it hide the options in their profile page? =

Yes.  Thanks to Rick for the suggestion.

= Does this plugin support custom roles? =

Yes!  This feature was added in version 1.3.0
